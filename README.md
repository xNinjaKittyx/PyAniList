# Unofficial API Wrapper for AniList written in Python.

This is simply a wrapper around AniList's API.

## AniList API Terms of use

- Free for non-commercial use.
- Using the AniList API as a backup or data storage service is strictly prohibited.
- ‘Hoarding’ or mass collection of data from the AniList API is strictly prohibited.
- If you would like to use the AniList API in a commercial client (this includes ads and in-app purchases) just drop me an email joshstar [a-t] mail [do-t] com and I’ll get back to you eventually. With the current usage of the API it’s rather unlikely any kind of profit cut etc will be necessary.
